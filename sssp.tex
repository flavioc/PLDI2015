The Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) program was already presented in
Section~\ref{sec:language}. We are going to update the code in
Fig.~\ref{code:shortest_path_program} so that nodes with the shortest distances
are selected to run before others nodes. The coordinated version of the same
algorithm is presented in Fig.~\ref{code:shortest_path_program_coord} and it
uses one coordination fact, namely \texttt{set-priority} (line 15). Note that we
also use a global program directive to order priorities in ascending order (line
5).

When using a single thread, the algorithm behaves like
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm~\cite{Dijkstra}. However, when using multiple
threads, each thread will pick the smallest distance from their subset of nodes.
While this is not optimal since threads do not share a global view of priorities,
many rule derivations are going to be avoided.

The most interesting property of the SSSP program presented in
Fig.~\ref{code:shortest_path_program_coord} is that it remains provably correct,
although it applies rules using smarter ordering. The derivation of
\texttt{set-priority} does not change the behavior of the logical rules and the
code remains declarative.

Figure~\ref{results:sssp_uspowergrid} shows experimental results for a variant of
the SSSP program that computes the SSSP for many of the nodes of the graph.
There are some situations where unecessary facts are propagated
because although the shortest distance is selected, sub-optimal distances may be
propagated because many SSSP distances are computed at the same time.
However, we see a reduction of over 50\% in the number of
derived facts when using the coordinated version \textbf{C} over the regular
version \textbf{R}. The results also show that the cordinated
version using 16 threads is 1.3 times faster than the regular version using 16
threads. In turn, this makes the coordinated version 20 times faster
than the regular version using 1 thread. Note that the coordinated program is as
scalable as the regular program.
