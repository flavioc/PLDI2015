Randomized and approximation
algorithms can obtain significant benefits from coordination directives because although the final
program results will not be exact, they follow important statistical properties and can be computed faster.
Examples of such programs are Loopy Belief
Propagation~\cite{Gonzalez+al:aistats09paraml} (shown in the next section) and
Heat Transfer.
